This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS.

# OptiSoftgit  KMP

A multimodule full-featured Kotlin Multiplatform & Compose Multiplatform e-commerce project targeting Android, iOS, Desktop, and Server platforms, built
with a feature-based modular architecture following Clean Architecture principles.

The app is fully **responsive** and **adaptive** across all major form factors — phones (portrait & landscape), foldables, tablets, and desktops.


## ⚡ Architecture Overview

The project follows a **Clean Architecture** approach with **feature-based modularization**,
ensuring separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability across all platforms.

## 🎯 Architecture Principles

### ✅ Current Strengths

- **Feature-based modularization** for better organization
- **Multiplatform support** (Android, iOS, Desktop)
- **Clean Architecture** separation of concerns
- **Dependency Injection** with Koin
- **Type-safe project accessors** for build configuration
- **Shared build logic** with convention plugins

### 🚀 Key Benefits

- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features as separate modules
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Testability**: Each module can be tested independently
- **Reusability**: Shared code across all platforms
- **Team Collaboration**: Different teams can work on different features
- **Build Performance**: Parallel module compilation
